                <h2>PERU BORN</h2>
                <p>Miguel Fernandez was born in Lima, Peru on December 6, 1987. Miguel moved with his family to Miami
                    shortly after Hurricane Andrew. However, since the storm devestated South Florida it forced him and
                    his family to move to California and stay with relatives near San Francisco. Miguel celebrated his fifth birthday
                    with his family in California before moving back to Florida.</p>

                <h2>MIAMI RAISED</h2>
                <p>The Fernandez Family moved back to Miami, Florida in 1996. Miguel's family settled in the small
                    neighborhood of Kendall - a suburb of Miami. Miguel attended Winston Park Elementary, Howard D.
                    McMillan Middle, and Miami Sunset Senior High School. He started his college career at Miami-Dade
                    College before transferring to Florida State University. He received his Certificate in Paralegal
                    Studies from the University of Miami. Miguel completed his first year of law school at Barry
                    University School of Law before switching programs and completing a Master of Science in Law and
                    Policy from Nova Southeastern University - receiving in the process an invitation from the world's
                    largest collegiate honor society given to the Top 15% of students, and graduating Magna Cum Laude from NSU.

                    <br>
                    Miguel's passion for the legal field has contributed to his success as a paralegal. Miguel focused
                    on helping victims of personal injury negligence; seeking compensation for motor vehicle accidents
                    and premises liability matters for his clients. Miguel has recently started as an Insurance Defense
                    Paralegal advocating for fair payments for property claims.
