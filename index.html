                    <p>Miguel Fernandez was born in Lima, Peru on December 6, 1987. Miguel moved with his family to Miami
                        shortly after Hurricane Andrew. However, since the storm devestated South Florida it forced him and
                        his family to move to California and stay with relatives near San Francisco. Miguel celebrated his fifth birthday
                        with his family in California before moving back to Florida.</p>
